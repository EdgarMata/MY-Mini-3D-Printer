### 3D model and Bill of materials
If you're thinking about building your own ME - Mini you can find everything you need here on this page, I'll leave the link to the 3D model I made in Sketchup as well as the BOM list and parts for 3D printing.
If you don't have a 3D printer you can use your favorite 3D printing service or, I also provide a 3D printing service which also helps a lot with my projects, you can use the links on this site to contact me.
